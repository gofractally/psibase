# psibase

This repo contains the sources to

- `psinode`, the psibase node
- `psibase`, the command-line utility for pushing transactions and booting a chain
- psibase contracts
- `psidk`, the contract development kit

## Binary Release

If you want to operate a node, build contracts, or explore psibase's command-line utility, we recommend installing a [Binary Release](https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/releases). We provide a single binary package which should run on most recent Linux distributions. See the documentation for installation instructions.

## Documentation

Documentation is at (TODO: add link). This covers installing the binary packages, starting a local test chain, and developing contracts.

## Building this repo from source

See the architecture-specific instructions below.

Set the `WASI_SDK_PREFIX` environment variable before building. Alternatively, use cmake's `-DWASI_SDK_PREFIX=....` option. Also make sure `nodejs 16.17`, `npm 8.19`, `yarn 1.22`, `cargo 1.63`, and `wasm-opt` (or later versions) are in your path.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache -Wno-dev ..
make -j $(nproc)
ctest -j $(nproc)
```

The built product lives in `build/psidk`.

To build documentation, use `-DBUILD_DOC=yes`

### Ubuntu 22.04

Note: building on Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 requires much more prep work; see [docker/ubuntu-1804-builder.Dockerfile](docker/ubuntu-1804-builder.Dockerfile) or [docker/ubuntu-2004-builder.Dockerfile](docker/ubuntu-2004-builder.Dockerfile) for details.

### Windows

psibase doesn't build or run on Windows natively, but some of our developers have very strong success with Ubuntu on WSL2. Docker and VMs are also good options. Use Ubuntu 22.04 if possible (above); it needs minimal prep work compared to the older releases.

### MacOS

Use either an Ubuntu 22.04 VM or a Docker Ubuntu 22.04 container. If your machine is ARM, you must use Rosetta; eos-vm JITs Intel machine code.

Some people have been able to build this directly on MacOS without using Docker or Ubuntu VMs. We struggled to reproduce these successes on other MacOS machines. For now, we don't have the people to answer questions relating to Mac. The error messages are nonsensical. The workarounds unreproducible. Apple mangled several tools and libraries such as libtool and openssl. Brew tries to replace them, but MacOS fights back hard. In some cases Brew is too careful about this and requires magic incantations to use the replacements; these incantations change with Brew's frequent version bumps. Building and running appear to require disabling several MacOS security features. Apple keeps changing the magic incantations to do this. Our existing developers need a multi-year break from even thinking of Mac.
