# Psibase app development

There are three components that can be developed as part of a Psibase app:

1. The [service](services/) - Server-side component that handles web requests and defines the actions users can take to update their own app data.
2. The [app interface](../specifications/app-architecture/app-interfaces.md) - Client-side component that wraps requests and complex interactions with apps and services into a concise and user-friendly API for consumption by user-interfaces.
3. The user interface - The typical client-side component that is presented to the user in the browser.
