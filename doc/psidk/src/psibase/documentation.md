# Generating this documentation locally

This documentation can be generated by mdBook when building Psibase from source by using the `-DBUILD_DOC=yes` flag with CMake. mdBook will generate this documentation based on the psibase source code, including the markdown files in `doc/psidk/src`. After building, the documentation can be viewed locally by navigating to `build/doc/psidk/` and running the command `mdbook serve`. This will expose the generated documentation at localhost port 3000.

# Hosting this documentation with Psibase

By default, running psinode will build and deploy this documentation such that it is served by the `doc-sys` system applet. That means it can be viewed in the browser by going to `doc-sys.psibase.127.0.0.1.sslip.io` (for a local psibase deployment).
