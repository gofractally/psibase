# Default apps

Psibase comes with default applications that bootstrap the initial functionality of the network. Ultimately, all of this functionality is customizeable by modifying the app code.

## System apps

System apps are the applications responsible for the core functionality of the network. Changing these applications could drastically alter fundamental properties about the network.
