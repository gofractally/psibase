# docs app

By default, running psinode will deploy this entire documentation site in the `docs` application. View it by visiting the docs app on your local node's host address (e.g. `docs.psibase.localhost:8080`).

# Building from source

This documentation can be generated by mdBook when building psibase from source by using the `-DBUILD_DOC=yes` flag with CMake. mdBook will generate the docs based on the psibase source code and the markdown files in `doc/src/`. After building, the documentation can be manually viewed either by booting a local Psibase network and visiting the locally deployed docs app, or by running the `mdbook serve` command from the `build/doc/` directory within this repository, which will expose the generated documentation at localhost port 3000.
