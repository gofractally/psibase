# Psibase app development

There are three components that can be developed as part of a Psibase app:

1. The [service](services/) - Server-side component that handles web requests and defines the actions users can take to update their own app data
2. The [plugin](../specifications/app-architecture/plugins.md) - Client-side component that defines app functionality and is usable by UIs and other plugins
3. The user interface - The typical client-side component that is presented to the user in the browser
