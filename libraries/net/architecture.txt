The link layer is a simple wrapper around peer connections.
It is abstracted as a message oriented send/receive protocol.

The transport layer provides multi-hop routing.  It provides the
following routing strategies:
- producer-to-producer unicast
- multicast to producers
- full network broadcast
The transport layer may pass messages to the consensus layer for validation
before forwarding.  The transport layer is only required to implement
broadcast.  Messages may be sent to a superset of the recipients.

The consensus layer is responsible for
- Deciding when a node should produce a block
- Deciding when a block is committed: a block can be committed based on headers
  or based on messaging at the consensus layer.
- It also may provide some block header components

The chain layer contains the block log, fork database, and state.
It is a pure data structure and never calls into other components.
- add_block: adds a block to the fork database and possibly switches to it
- produce_block: split into multiple steps: start/transaction*/end





Block broadcast algorithm:

on recv block, add to fork database

each outgoing connection has several possible states:
- off: never send blocks over this connection.  Manualy set only.
- backup: only send block ids (or maybe block headers?) over this connection
- active: send blocks over this connections

An active or backup connection tracks the last block sent to the peer.
When switching forks, send all blocks from the new fork in order

- If we receive a block over a backup connection, and it is part of the best fork

- If we have multiple incoming connections for a given producer, prune all but one.


- Goal, create a spanning tree per producer (?).  If the active producer
  rotates, then a per-producer spanning tree is probably needed.
  For RAFT the active producer should rarely change, so we can
  probably maintain only a single spanning tree and update it
  on demand...  but that will result in increased delays after
  a new leader is elected, which in turn increases the likelyhood
  of leader thrashing.  To compensate, we would need a higher
  timeout, which will cause the network to take longer to
  detect leader failure.


- If


- When two nodes establish a new connection, they find the nearest common ancestor of their best chains


- A node will only send blocks that are in its best chain
- If we receive a block from a peer than that peer knows all ancestors of that block


- GOAL: If N1 and N2 are peers, and N1 has an irreversible block that N2 does not,
  and messages between N1 and N2 are delivered in bounded time, then N2 will advance
  its last irreversible block in bounded time.  (synchronous liveness)

Desired invariant:
- If two nodes are both correct, then a block that is sent by either will never be rejected by the other.

- Each node tracks the peer's head block
  - The peer's head block can be changed to an ancestor at any time
  - Only an immediate child of the peer's head can be sent
  - After sending a block, the peer's head is changed to the newly sent block
  - After receiving a block, the peer's head is changed to the newly received block

- Each connection tracks 2 blocks, the last sent block, and the last received block,
  when switching forks, we back up to the nearest block.


Performance goals/ordering constraints on messages:
- Blocks sent MUST be received in the order sent
- A response to a block SHOULD NOT be required before
  sending the next block, because waiting for a response
  limits throughput.
- Routing and consensus messages SHOULD NOT wait for
  a block which is being sent on the same channel.
  Blocks can take significant time to send and
  delaying finality and consensus messages can
  cause user visible delays in the time to reach
  finality and the time for the routing tables
  to converge after any network reconfiguration.









Connection states:

Node states
start, initlow, inithigh, syncing, idle

Compound states (both nodes + in flight messages)
(start, start): hello, hello
  -> (idle, idle): identical hello
  -> (initlow, inithigh): different forks
  -> (initlow, syncing): one node ahead, either same or different forks
  Other combinations are not possible:
  -> (syncing, syncing): possible if nodes receive blocks after sending hello
  -> (inithigh, inithigh): high vs low is determined by the relative hello messages
  -> (initlow, initlow): " " "


start, hello -> init lower, init higher, syncing, idle

init lower, append_entires -> idle
init higher, init_sync -> syncing

- On connection start each node sends its head block info
- If a node knows the others head block, then it can immediately transition to an appropriate state
- If a node does not know the other's head AND its hello is worse than the other's hello,
  then it streams hellos backing up one block each time.
  - If the node sending hellos switches forks
    - If the new head is a descendant of the last hello, do nothing
    - Otherwise, if the new head is better than the other nodes hello,
      send a single hello.
    - Otherwise, start streaming hello at the new head
- If the better head receives a hello for a block that it recognizes,
  then it transitions to syncing.


- A node needs to know:
  - A block which is in its best chain and which is known to the other node
  - The best block info of the other node


What if?
 - Send hello and then fork away before receiving response?
  - if blocks are not orphaned, we're okay, because we can find the common ancestor
  - if blocks are orphaned, then discarding incoming blocks is safe
    - but... we don't know what to send and the peer has already transitioned out of start state
  - maybe allow a sync->start transition when receiving a hello?
    - If hello is better than current head, then transition to start
    - If hello is worse than current head, then it is safe to ignore because... why?
      - If current head is irreversibly forked, then trying to sync is pointless (is it really?)
      - If current head is NOT irreversibly forked, then the peer has not discarded


Possible node states:
- start, init, sync, idle

Transitions:
- fork switch
- recv message

Messages:
- hello
- block



- A node is in the init state iff the last sent hello is worse
  than the last received hello and the last received hello refers to an unknown block.






There are three possible communication models: synchronous, partially synchronous, and asynchronous.  Synchronous communication can be ignored, because it doesn't exist in the real world.  Asynchronous communication can also be ignored, because although real world systems do fall within an asynchronous communication model, it is too weak to provide the guarantees that we need.  In particular, asynchronous consensus cannot guarantee both safety and liveness.  Thus, for practical purposes, we only need to consider partially synchronous communication.

The second variable is the failure model, which can be either fail-stop or byzantine.

The final variable is the guarantees provided.  The two primary guarantees of a consensus algorithm are safety and liveness.


In addition to this, any analysis of the real world use of an algorithm must take into account the effects of manual intervention.  In general, a failure of liveness will result in manual intervention, which can result in arbitrary changes to the protocol.  Even if the protocol as coded does not guarantee liveness, it could be considered live if there is an obvious form of manual intervention that is guaranteed to preserve safety.  For example, a block with an infinite loop can be blacklisted safely.
