   /// Services should inherit from this
   ///
   /// Template arguments:
   /// - `DerivedService`: the most-derived service class that inherits from `Service`
   ///
   /// #### Defining a service
   ///
   /// To define a service:
   /// - Make a struct or class which publicly inherits from `Service`
   /// - Define or declare the set of methods
   /// - Reflect the methods using `PSIO_REFLECT`. Only reflected methods become actions; these are available for transactions and for other services to call using [call] or [Actor].
   ///
   /// Example:
   ///
   /// ```c++
   /// struct MyService: psibase::Service<MyService>
   /// {
   ///    void        doSomething(std::string_view str);
   ///    std::string somethingElse(uint32_t x, psibase::AccountNumber y);
   /// };
   ///
   /// PSIO_REFLECT(MyService,
   ///              method(doSomething, str),
   ///              method(somethingElse, x, y))
   /// ```
   ///
   /// #### Reserved action names
   ///
   /// psibase standard action names end with `Sys` or `_Sys` (case insensitive). You should avoid this suffix
   /// when defining your own actions if they're not implementing one of the
   /// [existing standards](../../standards/actions.html) documented in this book. If you don't avoid it, your
   /// service may misbehave when future standards are adopted. e.g. don't create an action named `emphasys`.
   ///
   /// #### Calling other services
   ///
   /// [Actor] supports calling other services. [Service::at] and [Service::as] simplify obtaining an actor.
   ///
   /// To call another service:
   ///
   /// ```c++
   /// auto result = to<OtherServiceClass>(otherServiceAccount).someMethod(args...);
   /// ```
   ///
   /// To call into this service recursively:
   ///
   /// ```c++
   /// auto result = from().someMethod(args...);
   /// ```
   ///
   /// You rarely need to do this. It has higher overhead than simply calling your own functions directly.
   ///
   /// #### Defining events
   ///
   /// See the following for a description of the various types of events:
   /// - [DbId::historyEvent]
   /// - [DbId::uiEvent]
   /// - [DbId::merkleEvent]
   ///
   /// To define events for a service, declare the event functions as below, then reflect them using the 4 macros below. Each of the `History`, `Ui`, and `Merkle` structs must be present and reflected, even when they don't have any events declared within.
   ///
   /// After you have defined your events, use [Service::emit] to emit them and [Service::events] to read them.
   ///
   /// ```c++
   /// struct MyService: psibase::Service<MyService> {
   ///    struct Events {
   ///       // Events which live a long time
   ///       struct History {
   ///          // These functions don't need implementations;
   ///          // they only define the interface
   ///          void myEvent(uint32_t a, std::string s);
   ///          void anotherEvent(psibase::AccountNumber account);
   ///       };
   ///
   ///       // Events which live a short time
   ///       struct Ui {
   ///          void updateDisplay();
   ///       };
   ///
   ///       // Events which live in Merkle trees
   ///       struct Merkle {
   ///          void credit(
   ///             psibase::AccountNumber from,
   ///             psibase::AccountNumber to,
   ///             uint64_t amount);
   ///       };
   ///    };
   /// };
   ///
   /// PSIBASE_REFLECT_EVENTS(MyService)
   ///
   /// PSIBASE_REFLECT_HISTORY_EVENTS(
   ///    MyService,
   ///    method(myEvent, a, s),
   ///    method(anotherEvent, account))
   ///
   /// PSIBASE_REFLECT_UI_EVENTS(
   ///    MyService,
   ///    method(updateDisplay))
   ///
   /// PSIBASE_REFLECT_MERKLE_EVENTS(
   ///    MyService,
   ///    method(credit, from, to, amount))
   /// ```
   ///
   /// #### Recursion safety
   ///
   /// - By default, services support recursion. TODO: make it opt-in instead.
   /// - When a service is called multiple times within a transaction, including recursively, each action gets a fresh `DerivedService` instance. However, it runs in the same WASM memory space as the other executing actions for that service. Global variables and static variables are shared.
   /// - Potential hazards to watch out for:
   ///   - If a call modifies member variables within a Service instance, other calls aren't likely to see it.
   ///   - If a call modifies global or static variables, this will effect both the other currently-executing calls, and subsequent calls.
   ///   - If a call modifies the database, other currently-executing calls will see the change only if they read or re-read the database.
   ///   - When you call into any service; assume it can call you back unless you opted out of recursion. TODO: make it possible to opt out of recursion.
   ///   - Calling other services while you are iterating through the database can be dangerous, since they can call back into you, causing you to change the database.
   ///
   /// The notes above use the following definition of "call":
   ///
   /// - Using actions in a transaction to enter the service
   /// - Using [call] or [Actor] to enter or reenter the service
   ///
   /// Calling service methods directly (e.g. `this->doSomething()`) don't count in this definition.

      /// The following examples use the example definitions in [Defining Events](#defining-events). After you have defined your events, you can use `events` to read them. Examples:

      /// * `auto eventAArguments = events().history().myEvent(eventANumber).unpack();`
      /// * `auto eventBArguments = events().ui().updateDisplay(eventBNumber).unpack();`
      /// * `auto eventCArguments = events().merkle().credit(eventCNumber).unpack();`
      ///
      /// These functions take a `psibase::EventNumber`, aka `uint64_t`, which uniquely identifies the event. These numbers were generated by [Service::emit].
