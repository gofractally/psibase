#ƒracpack ƒormat


ƒracpack is a zero-copy data serialization format that is a faster alternative to Google
FlatBuffers, Cap 'n' Proto. It was created to optimize the performance of database access 
and inter-contract communication.

It is designed to pack faster and smaller than FlatBuffers and to work without any code
generation in c++(templates and macros aside)

ƒracpack is designed to be forward and backward compatible,
allowing old code to read data packed by newer code and newer code to
transparently support data produced by old code. Data structures can add
new optional fields at any time at the end of the structure but may not reorder
or remove old fields.Empty fields are serialized as all 0's which allows them to be effeciently compressed,
if desired, using the algorithm from Cap 'n' Proto.

## TODO

1. variant needs a size prefix for forward/backward compatibility
2. must check that heap offset >= fixed_size 
3. must require that all fields after first optional are optional (compile time check)
4. must test structs with size 0, useful for variant tags, may not be used in vectors
5. must require that each offset value is a particular value
6. must signal when valid, but unknown types/fields are present

## Non Performance Benefits

1. Data is smaller 
2. There is a canonical representation (good for hashing and security )
3. No CPU Bombs (structures packed such that the parse time is nor corelated to data size)

This document describes the serialized format.

## Benchmark vs Google Flat Buffers

The following benchmark is representaive of serializing the following 
in an extensible way:

```c++
struct transfer { 
   uint32_t from; 
   uint32_t to; 
   uint64_t amount; 
   string memo = "test"
};

struct action {
   uint32_t sender;
   uint32_t contract;
   uint32_t act;
   vector<char> data = packed(transfer)
};
struct transaction { 
   uint32_t expire; 
   uint16_t tapos; 
   uint16_t flags; 
   vector<action> actions; /// 2 transfers
};
```

## Basic Types
 
The following basic types are serialized directly as if by `memcpy`, a
struct consisting of only basic types is also considered a basic type and
is serialized as if using `__attribute__((packed, aligned(1)))`.

  - char 
  - uint8_t 
  - uint16_t 
  - uint32_t 
  - uint64_t 
  - int8_t 
  - int16_t 
  - int32_t 
  - int64_t
  - float32 
  - float64

## Dynamic Types

  The following dynamic types have a data-dependent serialization size, this includes:

  - string
  - vector<T>
  - optional<T>
  - variant<T1,T2,...>

  Any struct that contains one of these types is also considered dynamic.

## Fixed Structs

These structs have a fixed number of fields and therefore have no forward or backward
compatibility. They may contain basic or dynamic types.

## Extensible Structs   (always on heap, accessed via offset ptr )

An extensible struct is designed to support forward and backward compatibility. This means
that old code can read data serialized by new code and new code can read data serialized with old code.

This is only possible if all new fields are `optional<T>` which forces the client code to check
to see if they are present. Old code will ignore the new fields, and new code will see missing fields
as non-present optionals.

The overhead for Extensible Structs is a 2 byte prefix which indicates the static size of the struct and
therefore the "start" of the heap. Any "optional" fields that have an offset greater than the static size
are interpreted as being "not present" by new code. 

All extensible structs are presumed to be dynamic because they will require "heap" allocation if any
new optonal fields are added in the future.

The format of an extensibe struct is similar to the following C struct

```c++ struct __attribute__((packed, aligned(1))) extensible
{
   uint16_t          fixed_size;   ///< the number of bytes until start of heap
   char[fixed_size]  fixed_fields; ///< user defined fields, a multiple of 4 bytes in size
   char[]            heap;         ///< dynamically allocated data pointed to by user fields
};

struct __attribute__((packed, aligned(1))) user_struct
{
   type       userfields... 
   char[] heap;
}
  ```

##Strings
Strings are serialized as if they were the following data structure where an empty
string has a size of 0 and no data or nullterm are included.

```c++ struct string
{
   uint32_t size 
   char[size] data 
}
```

##Strings in Structs

Given the following struct:

```c++ struct strstruct
{
   uint16_t    somefield;
   std::string str = "hello world";
   uint8_t     otherfield;
};
```

 It would be serialized as follows :

  ```c++ uint32_t size                                           = 25 uint8_t fixed_size =
        2 words or 8 bytes-- --start fixed-- --uint16_t somefield = uint32_t    offset_ptr = 6 =
            sizeof(offsetptr + otherfield + padding) uint8_t otherfield uint8_t padding =
                0  // fixed_size must be multiple of 4
    -- --start heap-- -- -uint32_t           string::size = 11;
char[size] string::data = "hello world" char string::nullterm = "\0";
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -
  ```

                              If the string were null,
    then there is no heap allocation and the memory of the offset_ptr is reinterpreted to be the
        size of the string and the null terminated string.

    Here is how strstruct would be serialized with an empty string :

  ```c++ uint32_t size                                           = 9 uint8_t  fixed_size =
        2 words or 8 bytes-- --start fixed-- --uint16_t somefield = uint32_t offset_ptr =
            0                               // string is empty
    uint8_t otherfield uint8_t padding = 0  // fixed_size must be multiple of 4
                                             -- --start heap-- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -
  ```

                                             ##Basic /
                                             Simple Vectors

                                                 Vectors are always dynamically sized data and
                                         utilize the same optimization as empty - strings,
                   so an empty vector reinterprets the offset_ptr to be the size of the vector.

                   A                      vector<Basic | Simple>
                       data is serialized as follows :

```c++ struct vector<T>
{
   uint32_t number_of_bytes;
   T[number_of_bytes / sizeof(T)] data;
}
```

    ##Vectors of Dynamic Data

        If a vector contains strings,
    other vectors, Extensible Structs, optionals,
    or any other type that may make use of an offset_ptr then it is serialize as a list of offset
            pointers to each pointing to a heap r

```c++ struct vector<T>
{
   uint32_t number_of_bytes;  /// includes size of heap
   uint32_t number_of_elements;
   offset_ptr[number_of_elements] data;
   //---- start heap ----//
   char[] heap;
}
```

## Nested Extensible Structs

If an extensible struct is nested under another struct, then an offset pointer is stored
and the serialized nested member is allocated on the heap. These types cannot be "null"
and there will be no check for a null offset pointer. When validated, pointers to nested
structs must resolve.

## Optional<T> 

Any type can be included as an optional, this means it will be represented as an offsetptr
to an object's heap unless it is an optional type of size less than 3. In that case, the
first byte will indicate the presense of the object and the next 1-3 bytes will store the
data. 

## Optional String/Vector/Variant/Extensible Structs

Optional members that are already an "offset_ptr", such as strings, vectors, and other
extensible types can leverage the existing offset_ptr to encode "not present";
however,
    it cannot simply use a `null` offset pointer as string /
            vector use that to indicate an empty string or
        empty vector which is different from a non - present empty vector.

                                                     An offset_ptr of value 0,
    1, 2,
    or
        3 points to the same memory that stores the offset_ptr which means no other object can be
            stored there.An optional offset_ptr of 0 means a string or
        vector is present but empty string.An offset_ptr of 1 means not present.

        ##Struct Extensions If you want to add new fields to a struct that is already in production,
    you must add them at the end as optionals.If new code is reading data produced by old code,
    then the old code will signal a fixed_size less than the new code would otherwise     expect
            .This means that                                                              an
        "optional" is also "not present" if it's offset from teh start of fixed is greater than the
            reported fixed size.

        In practice this means that                                  non -
        present optionals at the end of an extensible struct have no on -
        the wire overhead.


  ```c++ uint32_t size = 25 uint16_t fixed_size = 7 -- --start fixed-- --uint16_t somefield =
        uint32_t                                                                   offset_ptr = 6 =
            sizeof(offsetptr + otherfield + padding) uint8_t otherfield            optional<string>
                opt_str;  // a null str = 0, !optional<str>.valid(), then value 1
-- --start heap-- -- -uint32_t               string::size = 11;
char[size] string::data = "hello world" char string::nullterm = "\0";
int                                          extra-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -
  ```

##Variants

A variant is serialized in the following way:

```c++ uint32_t size;  // the number bytes
uint8_t            type;  // up to 255 types
uint32_t           size;
char[size]         data;
```
A variant has a size to enable forward/backward compatibility when adding new
types that old code has not seen. A size of zero is acceptable.

TODO: consider empty string or empty vector optimization.
