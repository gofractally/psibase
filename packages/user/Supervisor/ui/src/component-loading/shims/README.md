# Description

These are browser shims for core libraries that components may depend on. The wasip2 shims are copied from the minified browser shims provided by the BytecodeAlliance.

# Availability

Not all shims are necessarily available to components. The supervisor infra can be updated to allow/disallow different components access to different shims based on various conditions.
