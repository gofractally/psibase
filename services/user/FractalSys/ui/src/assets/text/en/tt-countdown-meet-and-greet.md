# Meet & Greet
The first 3 minutes of your meeting is when everyone is entering the room. During this time, say hello and get to know your group members.

Remember, you should be having fun in these meetings. As your Æ’ractal grows, you may not see these members again, so find out who they are and consider staying in touch afterward.
