# Not ranked
At the start of each meeting, all members are listed in random order - without rank. As you and other members share your contributions, move members into the “Most-valued contribution” area to give rank.

Members remaining in this area will not receive a rank when submitted. Not ranking a member can be part of a successful consensus. Note the icon indicators when giving rank.
