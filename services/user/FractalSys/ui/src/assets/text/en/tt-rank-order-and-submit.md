# Rank-order & submit
Check the icon indicators and confirm your group has reached a consensus. Then confirm with the group before submitting together.

3 of 5 or 4 of 6 group members must reach the SAME consensus to get paid. Those NOT submitting agree to the majority consensus.

You will not get paid for submitting a rank order that does not match consensus. The other members may get paid if they reach consensus without you.
