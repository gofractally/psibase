# Fractals

This is an autogenerated README.md file for the "Fractals" app.

By default, this app has a basic service, query service, plugin, and UI.

## Build

To build the app,

1. Run `yarn && yarn build` in the app's `ui` directory.
2. Run `cargo-psibase package` in the app's root directory.

That's it! A package will be generated at `./target/wasm32-wasip1/release/packages/Fractals.psi`

## Test

To run the tests,

1. Run `cargo-psibase test` in the app's `service` directory.

## Run

To run the app,

1. Run a local single-node network using psinode, as usual.
2. Deploy the app to the network by running `cargo-psibase install` from the app's root directory.

### View UI

The UI is served at the `fractals` subdomain of your local psinode network.
A graphiql interface is also served at the `/graphiql` endpoint.
